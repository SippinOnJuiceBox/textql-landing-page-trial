# Supabase & TextQL: Instant Insights from Your Startup’s Data

Today we are officially launching [TextQL’s Supabase connector](https://docs.textql.com/core/datasources/databases/supabase)—your direct path from raw Postgres data to actionable insights.  If you're using Supabase, this connector allows **Ana**, our AI data scientist, to analyze, report on, and clean you company's Supabase data.

- **Never Write SQL Again:** Prompt Ana to retrieve metrics, create visualizations, clean tables or help with migrations.

- **Automate Repetitive Tasks with Playbooks:** Use Playbooks for testing and reporting.  Schedule analysis and receive results directly in Slack or email.

- **Visualize Complex Relationships Quickly:** Ana can make diagrams, pdf reports, and interactive web-apps, tailored to your prompt and returned in under a minute.

## Why Supabase + TextQL?

Supabase has become the default database for “vibe-coded” apps—those blitz-built side projects and seed-stage products that win users before backend polish catches up. But as traction grows, raw SQL queries, dashboard sprawl, and ad-hoc CSV exports slow decision-making.

**Enter Ana, TextQL’s AI data-scientist agent.** With our new Supabase connector, Ana plugs straight into your Postgres tables, learns your schema in seconds, and starts answering product, growth, and ops questions in plain English. No more writing joins at 2 a.m.—just ask and Ana delivers charts, forecasts, and next-step recommendations.

## Watch It In Action

**“Build data-driven apps without writing a single query.”**

In this 2-minute demo, TextQL engineer Rodney connects Ana to a Supabase-backed sleep-tracking app and turns noisy production tables into crystal-clear insights.
