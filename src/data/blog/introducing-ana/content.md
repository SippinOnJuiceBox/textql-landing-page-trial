We killed the data team backlog. Ana is TextQL's AI agent that connects to your data warehouse, writes SQL and Python automatically, and delivers insights faster than you can schedule a meeting about it.

**Universal data connectivity**: Ana works with any data warehouse—Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Redshift—plus APIs for real-time data. When breaking news hits your industry, Ana cross-references it with your company data so you can get ahead of the curve.

**Autonomous analysis**: Ask "which campaigns drive revenue?" Ana writes the SQL query, pulls from your data warehouse, runs statistical analysis in Python, and delivers charts showing exactly what's working. No analyst queues. No three-week delays.
