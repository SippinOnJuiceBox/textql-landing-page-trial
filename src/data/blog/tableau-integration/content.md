# Tableau & TextQL: Augmenting Your Dashboards with Generative AI

For years, we've heard the same question: "Are you building another BI tool?" Today, we're excited to put those questions to rest with our Tableau integration release for Ana. We're not here to replace your BI tools – we're here to make them smarter.

## Bridging the Gap Between Visualization and Understanding

Business intelligence tools like Tableau excel at creating powerful visualizations, but they often leave users with follow-up questions that require technical expertise to answer. That's where Ana comes in.

### What's New: TextQL + Tableau Integration

Our integration brings together the best of both worlds:
- Tableau's industry-leading visualization capabilities
- Ana's natural language data analysis expertise

The result? A seamless experience where your dashboards become interactive conversation partners.

## Key Features

### 🔍 Visual Context Understanding
Ana doesn't just see the data – she understands your visualizations. When you ask a question about a dashboard, Ana knows:
- What each visualization represents
- How different charts relate to each other
- The underlying data relationships

### 💡 Intelligent Follow-ups
Ask natural follow-up questions like:
- "What's driving this trend?"
- "How does this compare to last quarter?"
- "Break this down by region"

Ana will navigate your data model, find relevant visualizations, and provide contextual insights.

### 🔄 Seamless Data Flow
- Connect different data sources effortlessly
- Build semantic models automatically
- Enable natural language querying across your unified data stack

## Watch It in Action
