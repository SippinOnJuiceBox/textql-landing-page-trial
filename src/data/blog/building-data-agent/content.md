At TextQL, we've developed Ana, the most advanced data agent in the industry. This post explores how we built it and the technical challenges we overcame.

## The Challenge

Enterprise data is complex. Companies have hundreds of thousands of tables spread across multiple databases, warehouses, and systems. Traditional approaches to data analysis can't handle this scale.

## Our Solution

We built Ana with three core principles in mind:

1. **Scalability** - Handle hundreds of tables in a single query
2. **Intelligence** - Understand complex data relationships
3. **Security** - Enterprise-grade security at every level

## Technical Architecture

Ana is built on our Dakota Architecture, which enables:

- State machine for runtime tool access
- Context management across queries
- Secure sandbox execution
- Real-time processing

## Results

Ana can now join 250+ tables in a single query, far exceeding any other solution in the market. This enables insights that were previously impossible to discover.

## What's Next

We're continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible with enterprise data analysis. Stay tuned for more updates on Ana's capabilities.
